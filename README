BlipKit - Sound Chip Simulation Library
---------------------------------------

BlipKit is a C library for simulating old sound chips. It generates waveforms
like square and triangle waves on different tracks with multiple channels. The
library itself is not able to output audio, it only creates the audio data which
then can be used otherwise.

The behaviour of a track is controlled by attributes which includes waveform,
tone, volume, panning, duty cycle and some more. A track can only play one note
at a time. To play chords for example, each note must be on its own track.  Or
arpeggio can be used to get the feeling of a chord.

There are some effects which affects volume and tone. Instruments can be used to
create envelopes and other interesting things. You may also use custom waveforms
and play samples.
